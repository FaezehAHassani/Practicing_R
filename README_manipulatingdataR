# use dplyr to manipulate data
- dplyr package is: _A Grammar of Data Manipulation_
- it helps you to perform important tasks such as:
 - select
 - filter
 - mutate: add more column/feature
 - arrange: rows in a particular order
 - summarise: e.g. mean, median, or maximum
 - join: multiple data frame

## intstal extrernal package for dplyr
 `install.packages("dplyr")`

 `library("dplyr")`

## use a real data frame example "U.S. presidential elections"
 `install.packages("pscl")`

 `library("pscl")`

# Note:
- If by mistake you re-wrote a downloaded data frame, re-start Rstudio and install the data frame package again
- ehen install a package, it may load other packages as dependencies, for instance "pipe" is loaded when you install dplyr
- `cmd+shift+m` help you to type %>% in R
