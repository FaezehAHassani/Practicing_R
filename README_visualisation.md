# Data visualisation

- a good visualisation helps to expose hidden data structure
- you can choose your visualisation layout based on your variable type
 - continuous variable: histogram, box plot or violin plot
 - bar chart for a few limited number of variables
 - proportional dependence by using stacked bar chart or pie chart
 - tree map for hierarchical data
- sometimes you need to aggregate your data (i.e. check the number of occurrences of different categories)
- for comparing between two continuous variables, the best choice is scatterplot. you can also make a scatterplot matrix to present multiple comparisons between pair of variables
- for showing relation between a categorical variable and a continuous variable you can use violin plot for each pair or use faceting for each categorical variable
