# Accessing web API

- Accessing data form a remote server on web (via URL)
- Web services allow computer program like R to access data by offering an application programming interface (API)

 - API is an interface that allows communication between two different systems
 - For example, the functions in `dplyr` package make the API for this package

- Many web services use a particular style for _where_ and _how_ their data be accessed, and that style is REpresentational State Transfer (REST)
- The functions used by web services foe allowing data access to computers are in the form of HTTPS (**H**yper**T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol) requests
- The web service response to the computer is in HTML format
- Companies like **Twitter, iTunes, and Reddit** make their data open to public through an API

# REST
- URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a generalised version of URL, commonly considered as **web address**

`https://domain.com:999/example/page/type=husky&name=dub#nose`
 scheme.....domain.......port....path................query...........................fragment
- domain/base URI and path/endpoint and query are the important sections of above URI format
- The JSON format data returned from a web API might be messy but if you install JSONView you get a cleaner version of data
- Example: `https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=dplyr&sort=forks`
- Many web services issue _access tokens_ also called **API keys**
