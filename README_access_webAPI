# Accessing web API

- Accessing data form a remote server on web (via URL)
- Web services allow computer program like R to access data by offering an application programming interface (API)

 - API is an interface that allows communication between two different systems
 - For example, the functions in `dplyr` package make the API for this package

- Many web services use a particular style for _where_ and _how_ their data be accessed, and that style is REpresentational State Transfer (REST)
- The functions used by web services foe allowing data access to computers are in the form of HTTPS (**H**yper**T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol) requests
- The web service response to the computer is in HTML format
- Companies like **Twitter, iTunes, and Reddit** make their data open to public through an API

# REST
