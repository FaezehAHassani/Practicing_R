# Data types in _R_
- Nominal often called categorical: Non-ordered, represented by strings, use for classification, cannot perform mathematical analysis on them
  **e.g. fruits: banana, apple, orange, etc.**
- Ordinal: Order for nominal categories, can sort, can find min, max, median but cannot perform statistical mean (note: median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population or a probability distribution.)
  **e.g. hotel rating: 5-star, 4-star, etc.**
- Ratio often called continuous data: Set zero, most common-level of world-data, can perform mathematical and statistical analysis
  **e.g. length: 1 inch, 2 inch, etc.**
- Interval: No set zero,
  **e.g. date: 01/02/2019, 04/07/2020, etc.**
