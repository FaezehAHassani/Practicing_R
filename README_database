# Accessing database
- it is cumbersome to download various cvs file from an online source. That source may have a database that contains tables.
- commonly used database is a relational database_.
- each table may contain only one feature but it has a special id/ primary key.
- you can use these ids to join the table.
- managing these databases requires installing other programs known as relational database management system (RDMS)
- a few examples of RDMS are:
 - SQLite
 - PostgreSQL
 - MySQL

**Note:**

- **you do not require RDMS in _R_**
- **SQL stands for _Structured Query Language_**
