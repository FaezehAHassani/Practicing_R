# What is data frame?
- Data frame is a table. Each column in this table is a vector.

# Tip
- Extracting/ filtering more than one columns will return a data frame while filtering one column returns a vector
- Always filter a column by its string name rather than its index

# Working with comma-separated value (CSV)
- Construct your own data frames by entering rows and columns separated by comma and store them in "file_name".csv
- Always include stringsAsFactors = FALSE when creating or loading a data set in Rstudio console, remember to do Session/Set Working Directory/To Source File Location
