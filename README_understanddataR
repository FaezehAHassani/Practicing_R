# Where data comes from?
- Sensors
- Surveys
- Record keeping
- Secondary data analysis

# Where to find data?
- Government publications open to public
- News and journalism
- Social networks and media organisations
- Scientific research
- Online communities

# Data types in _R_
- Nominal often called categorical: Non-ordered, represented by strings, use for classification, cannot perform mathematical analysis on them
  **e.g. fruits: banana, apple, orange, etc.**
- Ordinal: Order for nominal categories, can sort, can find min, max, median but cannot perform statistical mean (note: median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population or a probability distribution.)
  **e.g. hotel rating: 5-star, 4-star, etc.**
- Ratio often called continuous data: Set zero, most common-level of world-data, can perform mathematical and statistical analysis
  **e.g. length: 1 inch, 2 inch, etc.**
- Interval: No set zero,
  **e.g. date: 01/02/2019, 04/07/2020, etc.**

# Data structure
  - Data are presented in tables, each row (i.e. 1 to 4 in the table below) is a _record/observation_ and each column (i.e. Height, and weight) is a _feature_. Each _cell_ can itself be a vector or a table.
  - Below dataset has a dimension of 4 by 2.
  |         | Name     | Height  | Weight  |
  | :-------| :------  |:------  |:------  |
  | 1       |    Ana   |65       |30       |
  | 2       |    Abi   |76       |10       |
  | 3       |    Joe   |22       |30       |
  | 4       |    Ted   |100      |40       |

# Interpreting data
- Gain knowledge on data features and problem domain
- Understand data schema: what meta-data (data of data) is available to help you understand the dataset? who produced the data? what features the data has? learn the acronyms.

# Using data to answer questions
- Make sure you understand the question that you want to solve by using data
