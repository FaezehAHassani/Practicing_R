The seven rules of a great Git commit message

Separate subject from body with a blank line.
Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
Capitalize the subject line.
Do not end the subject line with a period.
Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
Wrap the body at 72 characters.
Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.

"Always in your local repo directory"


Status check => git status


Stage => git add FILENAME (specific to one file changed) / git add . (For all files changed)
