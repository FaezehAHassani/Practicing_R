# Programming Skills for Data Science

## Hello to _R_ learning!

### From Mac terminal

- type R in terminal

- quit R by q()

- Rscript fileNAME.R to rune your R file

### R syntax

- assign value to a variable use <- => number_of_days_in_a_month <- 30 or number_of_days_in_a_month <- "as I wish"

- check a variable value => print(number_of_days_in_a_month)

- selectively run a line in R codes by pressing at the end of each line `cmd+return/run`

- access the list of all shortcuts in R by `option+shift+k`

#### Always check the last value for the variable in 'Global Environment' panel of R studio if all the variables were printed


## _Fun facts:_
- shift + 4 is dollar sign
- double [[]] returns a vector of a list whereas [] returns a list => so better to use [[]] or $ to access the elements of a list
